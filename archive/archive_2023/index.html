                 Remote sensing  models of water quality can be improved by training and validation on larger data sets of coincident field and satellite observations, here 
		    called matchups. To facilitate model development and deeper integration of remote sensing into inland water science, we have built AquaSat, 
		    the largest such matchup data set ever assembled. AquaSat contains more than 600,000 matchups, covering 1984–2019, of ground-based total 
		    suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and Secchi disk depth measurements paired with spectral reflectance from 
		    Landsat 5, 7, and 8 collected within ±1 day of each other. To build AquaSat, we developed open source tools in R and Python and applied 
		    them to existing public data sets covering the contiguous United States, including the Water Quality Portal, LAGOS-NE, and the Landsat archive. 
		    In addition to publishing the data set, we are also publishing our full code architecture to facilitate expanding and improving AquaSat.

                Ecological forecasting, a growing field in ecology and aquatic sciences,  makes predictions of the future state of ecosystem variables with quantified uncertainty. Near-term freshwater forecasts are urgently needed to improve water quality management as freshwater ecosystems exhibit greater variability due to global change. Freshwater forecasting is currently dominated by near-term forecasts of water quantity and near-term water quality forecasts are fewer in number and in the early stages of development (i.e., non-operational) despite their potential as important preemptive decision support tools. Nonetheless, near-term water quality forecasting is poised to make substantial advances with recent progress in forecasting methodology, workflows, and end-user engagement. Looking ahead, near-term forecasting provides a hopeful future for freshwater management in the face of increased variability and risk due to global change, and we encourage the freshwater scientific community to incorporate forecasting approaches in water quality research and management.

I will then introduce how this workflow can be launched for free using cloud computing and describe work that allows these democratized forecasts to be discoverable through a simple web search.  The cutting edge software that has been developed to achieve these goals and lower the barrier of entry will be highlighted throughout.

This workshop will move through an example forecasting workflow: accessing the historical NEON observations, past and future driving data, forecast generation, and workflow automation using Github Actions. Using an R programming workflow we hope that you can go away from the workshop with a fully formed forecasting workflow that will allow you to submit a brand new 30 day forecast every single day!

		Macrosystem-scale watershed science is the search for general principles that describe functional capacity and behavior across watersheds.

		    watershed science at the macrosystem scale. The MacroSheds project has developed a flexible, future-friendly system for continually

		 The small watershed approach has been used to understand biogeochemical cycling in ecosystems since the 1960s, however little effort has been made to compare and 
		    synthesize watersheds at broad spatial scales. The MacroSheds project is an on-going data harmonization and synthesis of small watershed studies that enables 
		    cross-site comparison of watershed chemical fluxes, weathering rates, and responses to climate change. With this newly synthesized data, we can evaluate spatial 
		    variability in nitrogen cycling and export in small watersheds across North America. The same dataset allows us to identify responses to anthropogenic change, 
		    for example, recovery from acidification in Northeastern forested watersheds. These represent two analyses that are made possible by a large data harmonization 
		    effort like MacroSheds and should accelerate evaluation of ecosystem processes in small catchment.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. 
                This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. 
                If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
