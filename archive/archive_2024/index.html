                 To adapt management for climate change impacts on lakes, there is an increased need to project future changes in lake thermal structure and resulting changes in lake biogeochemistry. Consistent ensemble modeling studies to project global water quality changes are needed for policy-relevant documents, such as the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The international Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) aims to fulfill this need for simulating climate change impacts on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change scenarios. ISIMP prescribes lake simulations driven by climate forcing from gridded observations and different Earth system models under various representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCPs), all consistently bias-corrected on a global grid. The ISIMIP Lake Sector is the largest international effort to project future water temperature, thermal structure, and ice phenology of lakes at local and global scales and paves the way for future simulations of the impacts of climate change on water quality and biogeochemistry in lakes.

                Heat uptake is a key variable for understanding the Earth system response to greenhouse gas forcing. Despite the importance of this heat budget, heat uptake by inland waters has so far not been quantified. In this study, we use a unique combination of global-scale lake models, global hydrological models and Earth system models from the ISIMIP2b initiative to quantify global heat uptake by natural lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. The resulting values are placed this in the context of the global heat inventory, a multi-disciplinary effort to map the different components of the Earth energy imbalance.

Participants will explore theoretical frameworks to choose initial conditions (e.g. global hypsometry) for a global simulation, and compare it with local observation. Through hands-on coding sessions, attendees will gain practical skills in accessing climate change data ready to be used in a lake model. The workshop further enhances learning with real-world examples including: script demonstration for analyzing local lake changes, comparison of global and local simulations, and methodologies to link with hydrology.

                 Differential equations (DE) provide a means to simulate the dynamics of a wide range of ecological systems. Basic
				 DE-based models are nowadays fairly easy to implement. As system become more complex, however, obstacles pop up: How
				 to communicate a model with 10 state variables and 20 processes to users, students, or the scientific audience? How can
				 we validate and debug the equations step-by-step? How to make models fit for re-use? How to minimize computation times such
				 that sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation become actually feasible? The workshop gives an introduction the R package
				 rodeo which address all of the raised issues by two simple concepts: a standard notation and a code generator. The package
				 helps both beginners and experts to build comprehensible, high-performance DE models with a minimum of coding. Hence, rodeo
				 allows you to spend more time on identifying your system and gathering valuable observations.
