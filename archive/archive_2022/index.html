                 remote sensing, and give an overview of the main products and resources available for water resources and land management.

                The United States Geological Survey has undertaken the development of an operational system to deliver remotely sensed water quality 
		at Continental United States scale from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery.  This multi-year project is focused on evaluating published 
		methods of estimating water clarity, chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, and water surface temperature.  The products 
		of the project will include 1) in-situ water quality observations matched with remote sensing imagery, 2) re-processed historic satellite 
		imagery as well as ongoing data product production as new imagery is acquired.  The project is centered around an ensemble approach to 
		remotely sensing water quality parameters, incorporating the best performing image processing techniques in a final estimate.  This 
		approach allows for ensemble member selection to vary based on water quality conditions, and to estimate uncertainty based on ensemble 
		member divergence.  This presentation will focus on the framework used in the development of these products and initial results from 
		three test watersheds in the Delaware, Illinois, and Colorado river basins.

                The use of remote sensing data has historically been constrained to spectral and spatial information derived from a carefully selected 
		image or set of images. However, advances in data storage, computing, analysis ready data, and analysis ready science products are 
		revolutionizing how the temporal domain is used to map and monitor land surface properties and land cover change. Aquatic ecosystems 
		such as wetlands and lakes present a unique challenge for remotely sensed spectral data as their physical and biological dynamics can 
		vary so widely over different temporal scales. This talk will cover the power of the remote sensing temporal domain and how to use it 
		to our advantage to characterize, map, and monitor aquatic ecosystems and capture their hydrologic dynamics over time.

                Limnology, like other scientific disciplines, is facing a computational crisis, where the management, analysis, and reproducibility are becoming increasingly challenging. 
		    We all strive for analyses that are fast, accurate, and easy to update, but our projects are inherently complex, often using multiple data types or sources. 
		    Harmonizing many large datasets for analysis thus requires substantial computational resources, such as high-performance computing or cloud computing infrastructure. 
		    Workflow management software is a helpful tool that can be used for creating tractable data pipelines that identifies dependencies and selectively updates new changes. 
		    We demonstrate the power of applying a popular workflow management software in R, targets, to a limnology project. We describe the benefits of including a workflow management software 
		    into any limnology project and the potential limitations or challenges. Lastly, we present the role of workflow management software in the larger movement in science to be more technology driven. 
		    As computation requirements in limnology becoming increasingly complex, workflow management software is one of many tools that can facilitate our work.

							In this workshop, participants will learn how to apply the process-based lake ecosystem model,
							Water Ecosystems Tool (WET), for a given lake. We will take you through each step in setting up and
							configuring the model with the user interface QWET. We will also explore calibration and validation,
							and you will learn how to make experiments with the model. At the end of the workshop, we will
							open up for a discussion of the applicability of WET, future model developments and the use of
							auto-calibration and sensitivity analysis with WET.

              <em>Software and material</em>
		<br> 
		 To participate in the hands-on part of the workshop, you will need to have a working version of QGIS and the graphical user interface QWET. If you are a Mac user, we highly recommend you to apply a windows-partition on your system, as the QWET installer is only available in windows format.     
             <br><em>QGIS</em>
		<br>
		 To run QWET you need to install QGIS3 64 bit version 3.16 or newer (available here: <a href = "https://www.qgis.org">www.qgis.org</a>). We recommend you install QGIS3 64 bit version 3.22.
                        <br><em>QWET</em>
		<br>
		QWET is an open source QGIS plugin for application and user adaptation of the Water Ecosystems Tool (WET). The QWET installer and the QWET source code is available through Gitlab: <a href = "https://gitlab.com/WET">https://gitlab.com/WET</a> . To download the installer or the source code, you first need to set up a (free) GitLab account. We recommend you install QWET version 3.4.2. Please read the <a href = "https://projects.au.dk/wet/resources/#c37448">download/</a> instructions and watch the associated <a href = "https://projects.au.dk/wet/resources/#c37448">video</a> tutorial on how to download the software.
	                            <br><em>Case study data for Lake Ravn</em>
		<br>
		For our case study, we will work with the Danish Lake Ravn that is located in the central part of Jutland. The lake is approx. 32 meters deep with a surface area of 1.8 square kilometers.
You can download the case study <a href = "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/s3cfprob0vxoxs0z5zzbs/h?dl=0&rlkey=u904urmqs0xaapaw2m1t5mje3">here/</a> .The case study folder includes files to configure a GOTM-WET model to Lake Ravn with QWET with lake specific hypsography and inflow and weather forcing as well as in-lake observations and files calibrated parameters. 
	                            <br><em>PyNCView</em>
		<br>
		To visualize model output with contour plots, we recommend using the software PyNCView. You can download an installer (for Windows) at the bottom of this page (pyncview-0.99.8.msi):  <a href = "https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/pyncview/releases">https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/pyncview/releases</a>.

If you have problems installing the required software or downloading the case study, you are welcome to contact us. Also, if you have any other questions related to the workshop.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. This time in the schedule is to bring up such
                ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking,
                and other social activities.
