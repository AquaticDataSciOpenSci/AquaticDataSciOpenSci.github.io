                 The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), with NOAA's U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) as part of it, uses Biological and Ecological Essential Ocean Variables (BioEco EOVs) to standardize ocean observing data from communities like the
				 Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). The GOOS Biology and BioEco Variables focus on the abundance and distribution of key aquatic organisms. Using predefined lists of species, one can query biological occurrence data from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)
				 and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). After querying, users can analyze OBIS and GBIF occurrence data to study the abundance and distribution of these BioEco Variables. This occurrence data can then be combined with gridded and tabular environmental data served
				 by ERDDAP to further analyze into products (e.g. species distribution models). In this workshop we will demonstrate the tools and techniques for assessing ecosystem health using this open science framework.

                River channel bathymetry is a building block for aquatic habitats in fluvial environments; however, bathymetric data are lacking in many river environments. This presentation describes a large-scale geospatial data collection effort underway in the Willamette Basin, Oregon which seeks to produce spatially continuous observations of river bathymetry throughout the continuum of river conditions used by ESA-listed spring-Chinook salmon â€“ ranging from large, lowland rivers flowing through broad alluvial valleys to high gradient mountain streams flanked by steep canyon walls. Through partnerships with the USGS 3D Elevation Program and the US Army Corps of Engineers, this project has coordinated topobathymetric lidar data collection on approximately 600 km of river between 2023 and 2024, including remote, mid-order mountain streams where little to no baseline geomorphic data existed. However, environmental and financial constraints limit continuous topobathymetric lidar collection in the Willamette Basin requiring alternative remote sensing approaches to map river bathymetry. To address data gaps, we couple image processing, multispectral aerial and satellite imagery, and field survey data to expand bathymetric coverage. This presentation will highlight that river mapping through a range of environmental conditions requires geospatial data fusion using sensors deployed from aircraft, satellites, and boats.

                 The Toolbox for River Velocimetry using Images from Aircraft (TRiVIA) provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for deriving spatially distributed velocity vectors from videos or image sequences, all within an accessible graphical user interface. TRiVIA includes modules for extracting and resampling frames, stabilizing and geo-referencing images, defining a region of interest, enhancing images, performing particle image velocimetry (PIV) with an efficient ensemble correlation algorithm, visualizing results, assessing accuracy, and exporting PIV output.  In this session, the capabilities of the TRiVIA software will be illustrated through a tutorial based on an example data set collected from an uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS). The software is publicly available as a USGS scientific software product and can be obtained here: https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia. The data to be used during the tutorial comes from a USGS ScienceBase data release. For additional information on TRiVIA, please refer to two journal articles that describe the software in greater detail (https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4147 and https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4333).

							Abstract: Aquatic ecosystem models have evolved from the classical pelagic nutrient-phytoplankton-
							zooplankton models to increase in complexity in, among others, biogeochemical processes, food
							web, functional groups and behavior of modelled organisms. Also, the coupling to hydrodynamic
							models in 1- to 3-dimensions have deepened our understanding of the spatial dynamics of aquatic
							ecosystems. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts of ecosystem modelling while providing an
							overview of the current state-of-the-art in simulating lake ecosystem dynamics ranging from
							temperature and nutrients to macrophytes and fish.

                Lake ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles are experiencing detrimental changes with the progression of climate change. Global simulations project rising surface water temperatures and prolonged summer stratifications,
				but ecosystem and water quality projections are lacking. A key factor in lake ecosystem health is hypolimnion oxygen (O2) levels.  We use a multi-model ensemble (three lake models driven by five climate models) to
				simulate thermal dynamics (2015â€“2099) for 73 globally representative individual lakes under three climate scenarios. We use the output variables to model O2 depletion and project future hypolimnion O2 concentrations.
				While trophic level generally influences anoxia risk, with oligotrophic lakes (35%) being less vulnerable than eutrophic lakes (96%) in the last decade under the pessimistic SSP5-8.5 scenario, climate-induced changes
				progressively drive lakes into O2 loss and corresponding habitat degradation. If climate warming cannot be halted, reducing nutrient inputs is required for sustaining healthy O2 conditions in lakes.
