                River channel bathymetry is a building block for aquatic habitats in fluvial environments; however, bathymetric data are lacking in many river environments. This presentation describes a large-scale geospatial data collection effort underway in the Willamette Basin, Oregon which seeks to produce spatially continuous observations of river bathymetry throughout the continuum of river conditions used by ESA-listed spring-Chinook salmon – ranging from large, lowland rivers flowing through broad alluvial valleys to high gradient mountain streams flanked by steep canyon walls. Through partnerships with the USGS 3D Elevation Program and the US Army Corps of Engineers, this project has coordinated topobathymetric lidar data collection on approximately 600 km of river between 2023 and 2024, including remote, mid-order mountain streams where little to no baseline geomorphic data existed. However, environmental and financial constraints limit continuous topobathymetric lidar collection in the Willamette Basin requiring alternative remote sensing approaches to map river bathymetry. To address data gaps, we couple image processing, multispectral aerial and satellite imagery, and field survey data to expand bathymetric coverage. This presentation will highlight that river mapping through a range of environmental conditions requires geospatial data fusion using sensors deployed from aircraft, satellites, and boats.

                 The Toolbox for River Velocimetry using Images from Aircraft (TRiVIA) provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for deriving spatially distributed velocity vectors from videos or image sequences, all within an accessible graphical user interface. TRiVIA includes modules for extracting and resampling frames, stabilizing and geo-referencing images, defining a region of interest, enhancing images, performing particle image velocimetry (PIV) with an efficient ensemble correlation algorithm, visualizing results, assessing accuracy, and exporting PIV output.  In this session, the capabilities of the TRiVIA software will be illustrated through a tutorial based on an example data set collected from an uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS). The software is publicly available as a USGS scientific software product and can be obtained here: https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia. The data to be used during the tutorial comes from a USGS ScienceBase data release. For additional information on TRiVIA, please refer to two journal articles that describe the software in greater detail (https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4147 and https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4333).

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects.
				This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss.
				If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
