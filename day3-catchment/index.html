		Macrosystem-scale watershed science is the search for general principles that describe functional capacity and behavior across watersheds. 
		    Collectively, government-funded hydrology labs and experimental forests support hundreds of small watershed studies that collect very 
		    similar data. However, data harmonization challenges have limited attempts to collate these datasets in a way  that would facilitate
		    watershed science at the macrosystem scale. The MacroSheds project has developed a flexible, future-friendly system for continually 
		    harmonizing daily time series of streamflow, precipitation, and solute chemistry from 168+ watershed studies, and supplementing each 
		    with a comprehensive set of predictive watershed attributes.

		 The small watershed approach has been used to understand biogeochemical cycling in ecosystems since the 1960s, however little effort has been made to compare and 
		    synthesize watersheds at broad spatial scales. The MacroSheds project is an on-going data harmonization and synthesis of small watershed studies that enables 
		    cross-site comparison of watershed chemical fluxes, weathering rates, and responses to climate change. With this newly synthesized data, we can evaluate spatial 
		    variability in nitrogen cycling and export in small watersheds across North America. The same dataset allows us to identify responses to anthropogenic change, 
		    for example, recovery from acidification in Northeastern forested watersheds. These represent two analyses that are made possible by a large data harmonization 
		    effort like MacroSheds and should accelerate evaluation of ecosystem processes in small catchment.

		The MacroSheds dataset harmonizes chemistry and hydrology data from 169 watershed ecosystem monitoring efforts (and counting). 
		    In this workshop, we tour the MacroSheds platform, which includes a web portal and an R package. Participants will calculate 
		    watershed fluxes for a subset of sites and solutes, then perform ordination and classification of sites based on fluxes and 
		    watershed attributes. We will also demonstrate how to link MacroSheds data with complementary datasets like CAMELS/Caravan. <br> <br>

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. 
                This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. 
                If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
