                The application of near-term, iterative forecasts in ecological systems is now more critical than ever to address the challenges facing natural resource management. Freshwater
                lakes globally are increasingly threatened as a result of rapidly changing land use and climate, and novel forecasting workflows have recently been developed to predict future 
                environmental conditions in lakes in order to make informed management decisions for safety, health, and conservation. However, the nascent discipline of forecasting lake 
                processes is still deciding how best to develop forecast workflows such that they can easily be applied across many lakes. Our team is testing an open-source forecasting
                workflow (Forecasting Lake and Reservoir Ecosystems, FLARE) to predict future water temperatures at time scales relevant for stakeholders to make informed decisions. We have 
                successfully applied FLARE in six National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) lakes and show that water temperatures can be forecasted up to 35 days into the future. 
                FLARE's successful application in the NEON lakes is a step toward developing reproducible forecasts for future lake conservation and management.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. 
                This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. 
                If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
