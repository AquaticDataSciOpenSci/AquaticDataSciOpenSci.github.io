                Ecological research increasingly uses large, complex datasets and research methods that are intended to make science more reproducible. 
		    Workflow management software is a tool that can greatly increase the reproducibility and efficiency of research analyses, 
		    in part by providing options to make complex analytical routines more intelligible. In this talk I will outline what workflow management software is, 
		    why it is useful in ecological research, and what tools are available to implement it for projects using the R programming language.

                Limnology, like other scientific disciplines, is facing a computational crisis, where the management, analysis, and reproducibility are becoming increasingly challenging. 
		    We all strive for analyses that are fast, accurate, and easy to update, but our projects are inherently complex, often using multiple data types or sources. 
		    Harmonizing many large datasets for analysis thus requires substantial computational resources, such as high-performance computing or cloud computing infrastructure. 
		    Workflow management software is a helpful tool that can be used for creating tractable data pipelines that identifies dependencies and selectively updates new changes. 
		    We demonstrate the power of applying a popular workflow management software in R, targets, to a limnology project. We describe the benefits of including a workflow management software 
		    into any limnology project and the potential limitations or challenges. Lastly, we present the role of workflow management software in the larger movement in science to be more technology driven. 
		    As computation requirements in limnology becoming increasingly complex, workflow management software is one of many tools that can facilitate our work.

                Datasets from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) offer plentiful opportunities for ecological (and limnological) analysis and forecasting on a large scale. 
		    Their public accessibility and wide ranging topic matter make them ideal candidates for reproducible research, especially when paired with workflow management software. 
		    In this workshop we will build a simple, fully functional data analysis pipeline for a NEON dataset using the targets package in R. 
		    We will discuss how to build a targets pipeline that performs and links tasks such as downloading, cleaning, analyzing, and reporting results of an analysis. <br>
		    
		    This workshop will use the Targets package, which requires R. You can download R <a href = "https://www.r-project.org/">here</a> and RStudio <a href = "https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/">here</a>. <br>
		    
		    Details on R packages, script templates, and general workshop information can be accessed from the GitHub Repo <a href = "https://github.com/NEONScience/WORKSHOP-AEMON-J-DSOS-2022">here</a>.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. 
                This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. 
                If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
