							Abstract: Aquatic ecosystem models have evolved from the classical pelagic nutrient-phytoplankton-
							zooplankton models to increase in complexity in, among others, biogeochemical processes, food
							web, functional groups and behavior of modelled organisms. Also, the coupling to hydrodynamic
							models in 1- to 3-dimensions have deepened our understanding of the spatial dynamics of aquatic
							ecosystems. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts of ecosystem modelling while providing an
							overview of the current state-of-the-art in simulating lake ecosystem dynamics ranging from
							temperature and nutrients to macrophytes and fish.

                Lake ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles are experiencing detrimental changes with the progression of climate change. Global simulations project rising surface water temperatures and prolonged summer stratifications,
				but ecosystem and water quality projections are lacking. A key factor in lake ecosystem health is hypolimnion oxygen (O2) levels.  We use a multi-model ensemble (three lake models driven by five climate models) to
				simulate thermal dynamics (2015–2099) for 73 globally representative individual lakes under three climate scenarios. We use the output variables to model O2 depletion and project future hypolimnion O2 concentrations.
				While trophic level generally influences anoxia risk, with oligotrophic lakes (35%) being less vulnerable than eutrophic lakes (96%) in the last decade under the pessimistic SSP5-8.5 scenario, climate-induced changes
				progressively drive lakes into O2 loss and corresponding habitat degradation. If climate warming cannot be halted, reducing nutrient inputs is required for sustaining healthy O2 conditions in lakes.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects.
				This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss.
				If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
