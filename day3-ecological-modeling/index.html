                 The video recaps basic concepts of ordinary differential equations in the context of ecological modeling.
				 After watching it, you should be familiar with the nature of simultaneous ODE, the initial value problem, and
				 concepts to obtain dynamic and steady-state solutions. The video also highlights common practical issues
				 encountered in ODE-based ecological modeling. We will resolve the latter by a dedicated R package (“rodeo”) in
				 the corresponding workshop.

                 Differential equations (DE) provide a means to simulate the dynamics of a wide range of ecological systems. Basic
				 DE-based models are nowadays fairly easy to implement. As system become more complex, however, obstacles pop up: How
				 to communicate a model with 10 state variables and 20 processes to users, students, or the scientific audience? How can
				 we validate and debug the equations step-by-step? How to make models fit for re-use? How to minimize computation times such
				 that sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation become actually feasible? The workshop gives an introduction the R package
				 rodeo which address all of the raised issues by two simple concepts: a standard notation and a code generator. The package
				 helps both beginners and experts to build comprehensible, high-performance DE models with a minimum of coding. Hence, rodeo
				 allows you to spend more time on identifying your system and gathering valuable observations.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects.
				This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss.
				If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
