                Dynamical systems are found everywhere, in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering and business - ecology and aquatic sciences are no exception. <br>
                <br>
                
                One common approach to describe such systems is by means of differential equations. Following the ideas of Forrester, differential equations appear quite 
                naturally if we describe changes in a system in terms of growth and decay, which together make up a mass balance. A somewhat bigger challenge is to solve 
                these differential equations - some of us may still remember the challenges of differential calculus in high school courses. <br>
                
                <br>
                Fortunately, computer algorithms allow to solve even complex differential equation systems numerically. This has opened a world of practical applications 
                to be accessible for anyone that has a basic knowledge in scientific computing, or is willing to acquire this knowledge. R is such a scientific computing 
                language that offers powerful methods to solve differential equations. Moreover, some R-packages are especially designed to also solve spatially variable 
                problems that are often found of importance in aquatic sciences. <br>
                
                <br>
                The introduction will demonstrate selected examples: growth of organisms, predator-prey interaction, spread of diseases, and transport-reaction problems. 
                The formulation of such models in R can be surprisingly compact and close to the mathematical equations. <br>

                The workshop will introduce how to create numerical models from basic building blocks and how to solve them numerically. We will start with an overview 
                over available solvers in the <b>deSolve</b> package, give hints how to avoid numerical pitfalls and show how to drive models with external forcing data. <br>
                
                <br>
                Examples include resource limited growth, equilibria of chemostats (with package <b>rootSolve</b>), plotting functions, and a multi-species model in matrix 
                formulation. Finally, we will open the door towards spatially resolved models using package <b>ReacTran</b>. <br>

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. This time in the schedule is to bring up such 
                ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, 
                and other social activities.
