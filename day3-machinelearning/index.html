                Machine learning has tremendous, revolutionary possibilities. But as a beginner at data analysis, it’s hard to know when it’s 
                worth reaching beyond your basic statistical toolbox into the exploding bag of machine learning tricks. This talk (and workshop) 
                is aimed at people who want to know in what situations the jump to basic machine learning techniques is likely to be worth it  - 
                and also when you’ve likely to get more out of traditional statistical techniques. We will talk about the simplest regression 
                applications for which machine learning might provide an advantage. This is aimed at the beginner level and so the arguments here 
                may not apply to more sophisticated machine learning methods.

                Machine learning (ML) represents an attractive alternative to physically based hydro-numerical models, mainly due to their cheaper computational costs, 
                high performance, and to their lower requirement of physical and topographical data. Besides, in comparison with the traditional statistical models, 
                stochastic methods, and empirical formulations, such techniques have a larger potential in providing accurate and reliable predictions (Zounemat-Kermani et al., 2020), 
                fostered by the growing availability of sensor data and current straightforward open-source technology available.  
                <br> <br> 
                This keynote speech presents an overview of some recent ML applications in water hydrology and hydraulics. Works dealing with the prediction of water level 
                and rainfall-runoff, flood and risk assessment, sediment transport, odours in sewage systems, and water demands in the urban surface waters are shown and 
                briefly discussed.

                This 90-minute workshop is intended to communicate 4 things: (1) the basic conceptual differences between machine learning and 
                (most) traditional statistics, (2) how to fit and visualise a few basic machine learning models in R, (3) how to evaluate and interpret 
                your machine learning model, and (4) the common failure modes and how to avoid them. The focus will be on random forests because of their 
                relative simplicity and robustness, but we will touch on other methods as well. You will need a basic familiarity with regressions and with R 
                (we will use RStudio) to make use of this workshop, but nothing else. This is aimed at the beginner level and so the arguments and general 
                guidance may not always apply to more sophisticated machine learning methods.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. 
                This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. 
                If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
