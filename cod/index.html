    <h2>Code of conduct</h2>
    
    <p>We are adopting <a href=https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html> The Carpentries Code of Conduct</a> for our meeting. Violation of the code of conduct will not be tolerated and violators will be removed from the virtual summit. A short summary of the Carpentries Code of Conduct:</p>
    
    <p>We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity. By participating in this community, participants accept to abide by The Carpentriesâ€™ Code of Conduct and accept the procedures by which any Code of Conduct incidents are resolved. Any form of behaviour to exclude, intimidate, or cause discomfort is a violation of the Code of Conduct. In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we encourage the following kinds of behaviours in all platforms and events:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Use welcoming and inclusive language</li>
        
        <li>Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences</li>
        
        <li>Gracefully accept constructive criticism</li>
        
        <li>Focus on what is best for the community</li>
        
        <li>Show courtesy and respect towards other community members</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
    <p>The Community for Integrating Data Science and Open Science with the Aquatic Sciences (DSOS) and the Aquatic-Ecosystem MOdeling Network - Junior (AEMON-J) 
	    are grassroots networks focused on: </p><br>
    <ol>
    <li>sharing cutting edge research in the data science, open science, and aquatic science fields, </li> 
    <li>training researchers in the latest methods and techniques for data- and computationally intensive aquatic science, </li>
    <li>connecting early career aquatic scientists with potential employers.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>The impetus behind DSOS and AEMON-J stems from the increasing and critical need for data savvy skills for understanding aquatic systems at large spatial 
and temporal scales. Despite the demand for these skills, formalized training is often highly variable and non-structured between institutions. However, 
restructuring graduate training to accommodate such skills takes time to implement and can come at a cost, where discipline-specific materials may be 
sacrificed in order to incorporate new computer science, informatics, and data science topics. Furthermore, current evidence in the data science and 
open science literatures suggest that discipline-informed data approaches require discipline-specific knowledge (e.g., knowledge-guided machine learning). 
This dual consideration and demand for both discipline- and data-savvy skillsets implies that the science workforce still needs training in fundamental, 
discipline-specific principles as well as data and computational skills. </p>
<br>
<p>Yet, even when trainees develop these skills, graduate training is often designed to funnel ECRs towards academia. While a data- and discipline-savvy 
workforce in academic institutions is an excellent path, traditional university jobs are not scaling with the number of trainees graduating from institutions, 
	and non-academic career paths that require similar skillsets can be tenable options. </p>
<br>
<p>Therefore, DSOS and AEMON-J will be a joint Research Coordination Network (RCN) that serves as an advanced data-training and job placement pipeline by 
helping connect our community with academic, industry, and government job sectors. Our research network will coordinate advanced training workshops with 
environmental synthesis centers as well as research networks and will share the latest advances in Data Science, Open Science, and the Aquatic Sciences. 
A major aim here is to make the content openly and freely available for a broad and global audience. In this role, DSOS and AEMON-J helps fill the training 
void not commonly offered in graduate programs, and will prepare emerging researchers to have gainful employment that uses their skillsets. DSOS and AEMON-J 
also provide leadership opportunities for ECRs, including graduate students, to gain experience creating and leading these training workshops and summits, 
as well as managing diverse teams. Additionally, DSOS will help employers across a range of institutions appreciate the expertise that environmental 
	scientists trained in data-intensive skills can add to their teams. </p>
<br>
<p>To address the environmental concerns of the 21st century, we must build an interdisciplinary workforce with cutting-edge data literacy and skillsets. 
To meet these pressing challenges, DSOS and AEMON-J will contribute to the development of a creative and capable workforce that draws from disparate 
	fields such as limnology, geology, and hydrology.</p>
