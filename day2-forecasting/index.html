                Ecological forecasting, a growing field in ecology and aquatic sciences,  makes predictions of the future state of ecosystem variables with quantified uncertainty. Near-term freshwater forecasts are urgently needed to improve water quality management as freshwater ecosystems exhibit greater variability due to global change. Freshwater forecasting is currently dominated by near-term forecasts of water quantity and near-term water quality forecasts are fewer in number and in the early stages of development (i.e., non-operational) despite their potential as important preemptive decision support tools. Nonetheless, near-term water quality forecasting is poised to make substantial advances with recent progress in forecasting methodology, workflows, and end-user engagement. Looking ahead, near-term forecasting provides a hopeful future for freshwater management in the face of increased variability and risk due to global change, and we encourage the freshwater scientific community to incorporate forecasting approaches in water quality research and management.

                This keynote will articulate a vision for the future of ecological forecasting cyberinfrastructure that empowers anyone with an internet connection to automatically generate ecological forecasts that are executed daily, making ecological forecasting more accessible than ever.  First, I will describe the key components of an ecological forecasting flow from downloading data to forecast dissemination. I will then introduce how this workflow can be launched for free using cloud computing and describe work that allows these democratized forecasts to be discoverable through a simple web search.  The cutting edge software that has been developed to achieve these goals and lower the barrier of entry will be highlighted throughout.

                This workshop will get you forecasting by introducing the Ecological Forecasting Initiative Research Coordination Network’s (EFI-RCN) National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Ecological Forecast Challenge, a national-scale effort of generating real-time forecasts for ecosystems across the U.S. The workshop will focus on the Challenge’s Aquatics theme to make predictions, with associated uncertainty, of water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a concentration for 30 days into the future at 34 freshwater sites across the continental USA. This workshop will move through an example forecasting workflow: accessing the historical NEON observations, past and future driving data, forecast generation, and workflow automation using Github Actions. Using an R programming workflow we hope that you can go away from the workshop with a fully formed forecasting workflow that will allow you to submit a brand new 30 day forecast every single day!

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. 
                This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. 
                If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
