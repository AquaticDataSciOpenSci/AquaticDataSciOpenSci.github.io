                 To adapt management for climate change impacts on lakes, there is an increased need to project future changes in lake thermal structure and resulting changes in lake biogeochemistry. Consistent ensemble modeling studies to project global water quality changes are needed for policy-relevant documents, such as the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The international Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) aims to fulfill this need for simulating climate change impacts on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change scenarios. ISIMP prescribes lake simulations driven by climate forcing from gridded observations and different Earth system models under various representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCPs), all consistently bias-corrected on a global grid. The ISIMIP Lake Sector is the largest international effort to project future water temperature, thermal structure, and ice phenology of lakes at local and global scales and paves the way for future simulations of the impacts of climate change on water quality and biogeochemistry in lakes.

                Heat uptake is a key variable for understanding the Earth system response to greenhouse gas forcing. Despite the importance of this heat budget, heat uptake by inland waters has so far not been quantified. In this study, we use a unique combination of global-scale lake models, global hydrological models and Earth system models from the ISIMIP2b initiative to quantify global heat uptake by natural lakes, reservoirs, and rivers. The resulting values are placed this in the context of the global heat inventory, a multi-disciplinary effort to map the different components of the Earth energy imbalance.

                 The workshop delves into aspects of using ISIMIP data for aquatic modelling, offering a comprehensive approach to understanding and using climate change data effectively in a local lake or multiple lakes around the world. Participants will explore theoretical frameworks to choose initial conditions (e.g. global hypsometry) for a global simulation, and compare it with local observation. Through hands-on coding sessions, attendees will gain practical skills in accessing climate change data ready to be used in a lake model. The workshop further enhances learning with real-world examples including: script demonstration for analyzing local lake changes, comparison of global and local simulations, and methodologies to link with hydrology.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects.
				This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss.
				If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
