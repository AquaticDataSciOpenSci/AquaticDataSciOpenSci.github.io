                 Remote sensing  models of water quality can be improved by training and validation on larger data sets of coincident field and satellite observations, here 
		    called matchups. To facilitate model development and deeper integration of remote sensing into inland water science, we have built AquaSat, 
		    the largest such matchup data set ever assembled. AquaSat contains more than 600,000 matchups, covering 1984–2019, of ground-based total 
		    suspended sediment, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll a, and Secchi disk depth measurements paired with spectral reflectance from 
		    Landsat 5, 7, and 8 collected within ±1 day of each other. To build AquaSat, we developed open source tools in R and Python and applied 
		    them to existing public data sets covering the contiguous United States, including the Water Quality Portal, LAGOS-NE, and the Landsat archive. 
		    In addition to publishing the data set, we are also publishing our full code architecture to facilitate expanding and improving AquaSat.

                 Remote sensing provides a practical solution to monitor water quality at large spatiotemporal scales. This workshop aims to introduce participants 
		    to remote sensing, machine learning, and big data to develop water quality algorithms using the R programming language and open-source datasets. 
		    By the end of the workshop, attendees will have gained valuable skills and knowledge that will enable them to apply these techniques in their 
		    research or work effectively.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects.
				This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss.
				If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
