                 The use of remote sensing for environmental applications and ecosystem monitoring has exponentially grown in the last decades as it is one of the 
                  most powerful tools to understand the Earth’s processes from local to global scales. This trend is expected to continue as new data products, models, 
                 and sensors are being prototyped. This talk is oriented to provide unfamiliarized and potential new users with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of 
                 remote sensing, and give an overview of the main products and resources available for water resources and land management.

                The United States Geological Survey has undertaken the development of an operational system to deliver remotely sensed water quality 
		at Continental United States scale from Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery.  This multi-year project is focused on evaluating published 
		methods of estimating water clarity, chlorophyll-a, colored dissolved organic matter, and water surface temperature.  The products 
		of the project will include 1) in-situ water quality observations matched with remote sensing imagery, 2) re-processed historic satellite 
		imagery as well as ongoing data product production as new imagery is acquired.  The project is centered around an ensemble approach to 
		remotely sensing water quality parameters, incorporating the best performing image processing techniques in a final estimate.  This 
		approach allows for ensemble member selection to vary based on water quality conditions, and to estimate uncertainty based on ensemble 
		member divergence.  This presentation will focus on the framework used in the development of these products and initial results from 
		three test watersheds in the Delaware, Illinois, and Colorado river basins.

                The use of remote sensing data has historically been constrained to spectral and spatial information derived from a carefully selected 
		image or set of images. However, advances in data storage, computing, analysis ready data, and analysis ready science products are 
		revolutionizing how the temporal domain is used to map and monitor land surface properties and land cover change. Aquatic ecosystems 
		such as wetlands and lakes present a unique challenge for remotely sensed spectral data as their physical and biological dynamics can 
		vary so widely over different temporal scales. This talk will cover the power of the remote sensing temporal domain and how to use it 
		to our advantage to characterize, map, and monitor aquatic ecosystems and capture their hydrologic dynamics over time.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. This time in the schedule is to bring up such ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking, and other social activities.
