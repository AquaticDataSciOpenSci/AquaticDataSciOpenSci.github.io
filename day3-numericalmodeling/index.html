		The development and application of numerical aquatic ecosystem models has been a rapidly growing field in aquatic sciences. In an effort to understand the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and to aid in restoring and preserving water bodies, for instance by scenario analysis or in a forecasting framework, aquatic ecosystem models has emerged as powerful tools for science and management. In this workshop, we will learn more about the possibilities of numerical aquatic ecosystem models and how to configure, execute and apply the Water Ecosystems Tool model.

							Aquatic ecosystem models have evolved from the classical pelagic nutrient-phytoplankton-
							zooplankton models to increase in complexity in, among others, biogeochemical processes, food
							web, functional groups and behavior of modelled organisms. Also, the coupling to hydrodynamic
							models in 1- to 3-dimensions have deepened our understanding of the spatial dynamics of aquatic
							ecosystems. In this talk, we will introduce the concepts of ecosystem modelling while providing an
							overview of the current state-of-the-art in simulating lake ecosystem dynamics ranging from
							temperature and nutrients to macrophytes and fish.

							Lake models can be considered a virtual representation of a real lake ecosystem. This can be very
							useful, as this allow us to conduct virtual full-scale experiments, which would otherwise not be
							possible due to the temporal or spatial scales involved. The Water Ecosystems Tool (WET) is one
							such model, which has undergone intensive development for the past decade.
							<br>
							Exemplified by recent	model applications, this presentation will demonstrate how the model can be used to simulate: 1)
							long-term changes to an ecosystem; 2) the response of a lake ecosystem to an internal manipulation
							(e.g. removal of fish); 3) operational short-term water quality forecasts.

							In this workshop, participants will learn how to apply the process-based lake ecosystem model,
							Water Ecosystems Tool (WET), for a given lake. We will take you through each step in setting up and
							configuring the model with the user interface QWET. We will also explore calibration and validation,
							and you will learn how to make experiments with the model. At the end of the workshop, we will
							open up for a discussion of the applicability of WET, future model developments and the use of
							auto-calibration and sensitivity analysis with WET.

              <em>Software and material</em>
		<br> 
		 To participate in the hands-on part of the workshop, you will need to have a working version of QGIS and the graphical user interface QWET. If you are a Mac user, we highly recommend you to apply a windows-partition on your system, as the QWET installer is only available in windows format.     
             <br><em>QGIS</em>
		<br>
		 To run QWET you need to install QGIS3 64 bit version 3.16 or newer (available here: <a href = "www.qgis.org">www.qgis.org</a>). We recommend you install QGIS3 64 bit version 3.22.
                        <br><em>QWET</em>
		<br>
		QWET is an open source QGIS plugin for application and user adaptation of the Water Ecosystems Tool (WET). The QWET installer and the QWET source code is available through Gitlab: <a href = "https://gitlab.com/WET">https://gitlab.com/WET</a> . To download the installer or the source code, you first need to set up a (free) GitLab account. We recommend you install QWET version 3.4.2. Please read the <a href = "https://projects.au.dk/wet/resources/#c37448">download/</a> instructions and watch the associated <a href = "https://projects.au.dk/wet/resources/#c37448">video</a> tutorial on how to download the software.
	                            <br><em>Case study data for Lake Ravn</em>
		<br>
		For our case study, we will work with the Danish Lake Ravn that is located in the central part of Jutland. The lake is approx. 32 meters deep with a surface area of 1.8 square kilometers.
You can download the case study <a href = "https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/s3cfprob0vxoxs0z5zzbs/h?dl=0&rlkey=u904urmqs0xaapaw2m1t5mje3">here/</a> .The case study folder includes files to configure a GOTM-WET model to Lake Ravn with QWET with lake specific hypsography and inflow and weather forcing as well as in-lake observations and files calibrated parameters. 
	                            <br><em>PyNCView</em>
		<br>
		To visualize model output with contour plots, we recommend using the software PyNCView. You can download an installer (for Windows) at the bottom of this page (pyncview-0.99.8.msi):  <a href = https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/pyncview/releases">https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/pyncview/releases</a>.

If you have problems installing the required software or downloading the case study, you are welcome to contact us. Also, if you have any other questions related to the workshop.

                A traditional part of AEMON-J meetings in the past has been to openly discuss ideas for new, joint projects. This time in the schedule is to bring up such
                ideas, perhaps inspired by the workshops earlier that day, and discuss. If no such ideas are pitched, this time can also be used for small talk, networking,
                and other social activities.
