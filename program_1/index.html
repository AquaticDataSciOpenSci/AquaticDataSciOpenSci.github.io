                To adapt management for climate change impacts on lakes, there is an increased need to project future changes in lake thermal structure and resulting changes in lake biogeochemistry. Consistent ensemble modeling studies to project global water quality changes are needed for policy-relevant documents, such as the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The international Lake Sector of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) aims to fulfill this need for simulating climate change impacts on lakes using an ensemble of lake models and climate change scenarios. ISIMP prescribes lake simulations driven by climate forcing from gridded observations and different Earth system models under various representative greenhouse gas concentration pathways (RCPs), all consistently bias-corrected on a global grid. The ISIMIP Lake Sector is the largest international effort to project future water temperature, thermal structure, and ice phenology of lakes at local and global scales and paves the way for future simulations of the impacts of climate change on water quality and biogeochemistry in lakes.

                Please join us for a session centered around the recently launched Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite. Our first talk introduces
		    the satellite and gives a few examples of SWOT applications surrounding inland hydrology. Our keynote talk, which will be streamed live followed by a
		    Q&A, will highlight two different research applications using SWOT data. Finally, our workshop organizers from the Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive (PODAAC)
		    will lead a hands-on workshop introducing access to SWOT satellite data in various forms.

                Differential equations (DE) provide a means to simulate the dynamics of a wide range of ecological systems. Basic DE-based models are nowadays fairly easy to implement. As systems become more complex, 
		    however, obstacles pop up: How to communicate a model with 10 state variables and 20 processes to users, students, or the scientific audience? How can we validate and debug the equations step-by-step? 
		    How to make models fit for re-use? How to minimize computation times such that sensitivity analysis and parameter estimation become actually feasible? This workshop will cover all of this and more as 
		    we will explore how to create your own DE models for understanding multivariate components of ecological systems.
