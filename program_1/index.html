                The Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS), with NOAA's U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) as part of it, uses Biological and Ecological Essential Ocean Variables (BioEco EOVs) to standardize ocean observing data from communities like the
				Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON). The GOOS Biology and BioEco Variables focus on the abundance and distribution of key aquatic organisms. Using predefined lists of species, one can query biological occurrence data from the Ocean Biodiversity Information System (OBIS)
				and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). After querying, users can analyze OBIS and GBIF occurrence data to study the abundance and distribution of these BioEco Variables. This occurrence data can then be combined with gridded and tabular environmental data served
				by ERDDAP to further analyze into products (e.g. species distribution models). In this workshop we will demonstrate the tools and techniques for assessing ecosystem health using this open science framework.

                The Toolbox for River Velocimetry using Images from Aircraft (TRiVIA) provides a complete, end-to-end workflow for deriving spatially distributed velocity vectors from videos or image sequences, all within an accessible graphical user interface. TRiVIA includes modules for extracting and resampling frames, stabilizing and geo-referencing images, defining a region of interest, enhancing images, performing particle image velocimetry (PIV) with an efficient ensemble correlation algorithm, visualizing results, assessing accuracy, and exporting PIV output.  In this session, the capabilities of the TRiVIA software will be illustrated through a tutorial based on an example data set collected from an uncrewed aircraft systems (UAS). The software is publicly available as a USGS scientific software product and can be obtained here: https://code.usgs.gov/wma/osd/trivia. The data to be used during the tutorial comes from a USGS ScienceBase data release. For additional information on TRiVIA, please refer to two journal articles that describe the software in greater detail (https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4147 and https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.4333).
